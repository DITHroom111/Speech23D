# Poly API - Web Sample

Copyright (c) 2017 Google Inc. All rights reserved.

This is a sample project showing how to invoke the
[Poly API](https://developers.google.com/poly) from
a web app.

## How to run

First, generate an API Key for the Poly API following the instructions in [the
developer documentation](https://developers.google.com/poly/develop).

Then, enter your API key in each of the HTML files in this sample, replacing
the value of the `API_KEY` variable:

    const API_KEY = "*** INSERT YOUR API KEY HERE ***";

When replacing, do not leave the asterisks, replace the entire string by
your API Key.

Place the sample files at the root directory of your web server.
If you have Python installed, you can use the `SimpleHTTPServer` module
to serve a local directory for testing:

    cd /path/to/sample
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

These are the available samples:

* **basic-sample.html**. Shows how to load and display a single asset
  with known ID.

* **search-sample.html**. Shows how to search for assets and display them.

* **tiltbrush-sample.html**. Shows how to load and display a Tilt Brush sketch.
